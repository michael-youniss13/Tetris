# Tetris
## By Michael Youniss

This is the game of Tetris coded in Java that I completed for a computer science course my Freshman Year

### How it Works:
I created a 2D Array which is the Tetris Field (Game Play Field) and then created each Tetris piece to randomly fall from the top of the Field and Populate the board as it enters its final location. Feel free to look around and explore the code morein depth.

### How to play:
Download the .jar  file about and double click it and the game should begin! Enjoy!
